# Wishlist app
The goal of this project is to learn how to use the Go programming language.

I want to build a REST API using Go and the gin package. The API will be protected by an authentication system that uses JWT tokens to authenticate the requests. The API will also be connected to a PostgreSQL data base.
The frontend will be developed with Angular 19.

That Wishlist app will allow users to create and share wishlists with their friends and family. Only the owner will be allowed to add items to the list, while contributors (Friends and family) will only be able to
assign items from the wishlist to themselves. The twist, only contributors will be able to see that items have been assigned to someone, not the owner.

This will be very useful for next Christmas with my family ðŸŒ²
